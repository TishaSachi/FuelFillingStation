# FuelFillingStation
A repository for a simulation based case study on the performance of a fuel filling station


This project simulates the daily operation of the Hanwella Ceypetco Fuel Station using the SimPy library in Python. The goal is to analyze station performance under different conditions and find ways to reduce waiting time and overcrowd.


---  How to Run the Simulation ----

1. Install Required Libraries

ðŸ‘‰Run this code - pip install simpy matplotlib numpy


2. Run the Simulation

Open the Python file (main.py).
Run it in any IDE (like PyCharm, VS Code) or terminal:

ðŸ‘‰run this code if you use the terminal - python fuel_station_simulation.py


3. View Results

View the results in the console and as graphs:
    Average wait time
    Total service time
    Queue lengths for each fuel type.



--- Modify Parameters ----

You can change:
    Arrival rates, pumps, or workers
    Fueling speed or simulation duration
    Add new scenarios like peak hours or extra pumps

Purpose: 
To test and compare how resource changes affect station performance and customer waiting time.
